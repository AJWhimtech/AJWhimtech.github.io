            <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect personal information, there is minimal information to share. We do not sell, trade, or rent any user information. Limited technical data may be shared only in these circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party services that help us operate our apps (crash reporting services, app stores)</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain minimal technical data only as long as necessary:</p>
            <ul>

            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect any information we might receive against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
            <div class="privacy-highlight">
                <h3>Special Protection for Young Children</h3>
                <p>Our apps are specifically designed for young children although anyone can enjoy them. We provide enhanced privacy protection:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Zero data collection from children of any age</li>
                    <li>No account creation, registration, or personal information required</li>
                    <li>No communication features or ability to share information online</li>
                    <li>All app content and creations remain on the device</li>
                    <li>No advertising or third-party content</li>
                    <li>Parents can safely allow use without privacy concerns</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We fully comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by design - we simply don't collect any personal information from users of any age.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect personal information, most data rights don't apply. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> All app content is stored locally on your device and belongs to you</li>
                <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes all local data</li>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can contact us for information about any support communications</li>
                <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> Users may choose to not use our services</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
            <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have specific rights. Since we don't collect personal information as defined by CCPA, most provisions don't apply. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not sell personal information</li>
                <li>We do not discriminate based on privacy choices</li>
                <li>You can request information about our data practices</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Categories of Information (CCPA Disclosure)</h3>
            <p>In the past 12 months, we have not collected personal information in the categories defined by CCPA. The only technical information we may collect does not constitute "personal information" under CCPA as it cannot identify individuals.</p>

            <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there are no personal data transfers. Any technical information is processed in the United States where our company is located.</p>

            <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
            <p>Our mobile applications do not respond to Do Not Track signals because we don't track users. Our website does not track users across third-party websites.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
            <p>Our Service may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites you visit.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by:</p>

            </ul>
